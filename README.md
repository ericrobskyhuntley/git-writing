# Git Writing

This package accomplishes a growing number of tasks associated with reproducable and version-controlled academic writing. If you've been looking for a package to...

+ build beautiful documents using a Pandoc-LaTeX workflow that are also capable of folding in Git version control metadata.

...this might be for you. It includes templates for multiple types of writing
